Gameplay feel / usability
- Outfit & tags: If you want it to show up on more auto-outfits, add tags like Worker, Hunter, or whatever matches your design under <defaultOutfitTags>.
- Smelting / reclaiming: Consider adding smeltability or a reclaim recipe (via defs or patches) so it doesn’t feel “dead-end” once damaged or obsolete.

Visual polish
- Icon clarity: Double-check that the inventory/world icon for the flak duster reads clearly at RimWorld's normal sizes; adjust contrast/outline if needed.

Compatibility & maintenance
- Style patches: Periodically verify that Anthitei's style framework and style pack defNames used in the patch files still match current versions.
